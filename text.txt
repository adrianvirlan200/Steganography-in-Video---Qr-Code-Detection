items including -- if the promotional photos are an accurate representation -- a cold beer. Note to

"Delivery is one of the possible things you can do with Sky, and it's the thing that makes the
most noise," Flytrex co-founder Yariv Bash tells me over the phone when | bring up the
photo, "but we're also talking about a cloud-connected drone with web API.”

Flytrex has been around for about a year and this is its first foray into ready-to-fly drone
hardware. Bash is also a founder of SpacelL, an Israeli nonprofit that's competing in the
Google Lunar X Prize and has raised more than $50M. He and a friend began playing
around with drones and had the idea of trying to gamify the experience. They came up with
an idea to create a kind of black box for drones. "You could use it to upload data, see
where it's been, what the altitude was,” says Bash. "There wasn't anything on the market
that you could just plug into your drone."
